# CLAUDE.md - Documentation

This directory contains project documentation and analysis reports.

## Current Documentation

### `initial-codebase-report.md`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis of the codebase architecture, technologies, and patterns

**Contents**:
- Executive summary of the Waldensian Map project
- Entry points and folder structure analysis
- Technology stack breakdown
- Testing status (currently none implemented)
- Coding patterns and conventions
- Custom commands and scripts
- Architectural decisions and rationale
- Future enhancement opportunities
- Dependencies analysis

**Usage**: Reference for understanding project architecture and making informed development decisions.

## Documentation Standards

### Report Format
**Structured documentation approach**:
- Executive summary for quick overview
- Detailed sections with clear headings
- Code examples where relevant
- Future recommendations
- Generated timestamps for currency tracking

### Markdown Conventions
**Consistent formatting**:
- Use `##` for major sections
- Use `###` for subsections
- Code blocks with language specification
- **Bold** for emphasis on key concepts
- Bullet points for lists and features
- Tables for structured data comparison

## Documentation Categories

### Technical Analysis
**Current**: `initial-codebase-report.md`
**Future considerations**:
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- API documentation
- Database schema documentation
- Performance analysis reports

### Development Guides
**Potential additions**:
- Getting started guide for new developers
- Deployment procedures
- Testing strategy documentation
- Code review guidelines

### Project Documentation
**Historical and context information**:
- Project timeline and milestones
- Feature requirements and specifications
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Historical accuracy guidelines

## Best Practices for Documentation

### Update Frequency
- **Living documents**: Update when architecture changes
- **Analysis reports**: Generate new reports for major releases
- **Decision records**: Document when significant decisions are made
- **Version control**: Commit documentation changes with related code changes

### Documentation-as-Code
**Treat documentation as part of the codebase**:
- Store in version control with code
- Review documentation changes in pull requests
- Keep documentation close to relevant code
- Use markdown for consistency and portability

### Accessibility
**Clear and inclusive documentation**:
- Use plain language where possible
- Include code examples for complex concepts
- Provide context for historical and technical terms
- Structure content with clear headings and navigation

## Integration with Development Workflow

### CLAUDE.md Network
**Directory-specific guidance files**:
- Root `CLAUDE.md`: Overall project guidance
- `src/app/components/CLAUDE.md`: Map component patterns
- `src/app/data/CLAUDE.md`: Data management guidelines
- `src/components/ui/CLAUDE.md`: UI component usage
- Additional CLAUDE.md files in specialized directories

**Purpose**: Provide immediate, contextual guidance for AI assistants and developers working in specific areas of the codebase.

### Documentation Maintenance
**Responsibility matrix**:
- **Architectural changes**: Update technical analysis reports
- **New features**: Document in relevant CLAUDE.md files
- **API changes**: Update integration documentation
- **Performance optimizations**: Record in analysis reports

## Future Documentation Needs

### User-Facing Documentation
**When the application grows**:
- User guide for map navigation
- Historical content attribution and sources
- Accessibility features and keyboard shortcuts
- Mobile usage patterns and gestures

### Developer Documentation
**As the team expands**:
- Contributing guidelines
- Code style and linting rules
- Git workflow and branching strategy
- Environment setup and configuration

### Operations Documentation
**For production deployment**:
- Deployment procedures and rollback steps
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Performance benchmarks and optimization guides
- Backup and recovery procedures

### API Documentation
**If external integrations develop**:
- GraphQL schema documentation
- REST API endpoints (if applicable)
- Authentication and authorization guides
- Rate limiting and error handling

## Documentation Tools and Automation

### Current Approach
**Manual documentation creation**:
- Markdown files in version control
- Analysis generated through codebase examination
- Contextual CLAUDE.md files for specialized guidance

### Future Automation Opportunities
**Documentation generation**:
- TypeScript interface documentation from JSDoc comments
- Component API documentation from prop interfaces
- Architecture diagrams from codebase analysis
- Test coverage reports and documentation

### Quality Assurance
**Documentation review process**:
- Spell-check and grammar review
- Technical accuracy verification
- Code example testing
- Link validation and maintenance

## Historical Context Documentation

### Waldensian Movement
**Educational content requirements**:
- Historical accuracy standards
- Source citation requirements
- Cultural sensitivity guidelines
- Academic reference maintenance

### Project Evolution
**Development history tracking**:
- Major architectural decisions and reasoning
- Technology choice justifications
- Feature addition timeline
- Performance optimization history

## Accessibility in Documentation
