**Task:** Expand Waldensian locations data to 50 entries with enhanced content
**Status:** Issue discovered - verifying agent work quality
**Completed:**
- Launched wmp-coordinator agent to expand locations from 13 to 50 entries
- Agent reported successful completion with comprehensive content
- Discovered formatting issue: agent used plain text with \n escapes instead of markdown as requested
**Current:** Analyzing actual JSON output to verify agent work against requirements
**Next:**
- Assess whether to accept current work or request corrections
- Ensure markdown formatting requirement is properly addressed
- Verify content quality and historical accuracy
**Context:** User specifically requested markdown formatting but agent delivered plain text with newline escapes. Content quality appears good but formatting requirement not met. Need to determine next steps for compliance.
