# /morning Command

**VERY MANDATORY Actions:**

1. **Read CLAUDE.md** if you haven't yet
2. **Read .claude/current-plan-and-tasks.md**
3. **Check for claude-main checkpoint**: Read latest `.claude/checkpoints/claude-main-*.md` if present
4. **Report related checkpoints**: List any other checkpoint files from the same date as your latest checkpoint (indicates same crash session)
5. **Acknowledge which files you ACTUALLY, FOR REALSIES, read. DO NOT MAKE UP STUFF.**

**Checkpoint Logic:**
- If `claude-main-[DATE]-*.md` exists, check for other `*-[SAME-DATE]-*.md` files
- List all agents that were interrupted in the same crash session
- This helps you remember who was working and what context to restore
